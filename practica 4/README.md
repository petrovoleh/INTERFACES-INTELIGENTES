## Project Overview


## Project Description

This project involves the development of a Unity game with various mechanics and tasks to be completed. The game revolves around a cube interacting with spheres and a cylinder, with specific behaviors for different interactions.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Sphere-Cylinder Interaction

- **Description:** Spheres of type 1 change color, and spheres of type 2 move toward the cylinder when the cube collides with the cylinder.
- **Implementation:** A script named CubeCollision attached to the cube handles the collision and modifies the spheres' color and movement accordingly.

### Task 2: Cube-Sphere Interaction

- **Description:** When the cube collides with objects other than spheres from group 1, spheres from group 1 move towards the cylinder. When the cube touches any sphere from group 1, spheres from group 2 increase in size.
- **Implementation:** An extended named CubeCollision2 script for the cube manages the new collision behaviors as described .

### Task 3: Complex Sphere Behaviors

- **Description:** When the cube approaches the cylinder, spheres in group 1 change color and jump, and spheres in group 2 orient themselves towards an object in the scene.
- **Implementation:** The cube script named CubeCollision3 includes logic for color change and  sphere jumping and orientation.

### Task 4: Scoring Mechanism

- **Description:** Implement a scoring system where spheres of type 1 add up to 5 points, and spheres of type 2 add up to 10 points. Display the score on the console.
- **Implementation:** A GameManager script is added to handle scoring, and a ScoreUI script is used to display the score.

### Task 5: User Interface

- **Description:** Create an interface to display the cube's score.
- **Implementation:** A Canvas with a Text component is used to create the user interface, and a script updates the score on the interface.

### Task 6: Scene Creation

- **Description:** Create a new scene that includes all project elements and mechanics.
- **Implementation:** A new scene is designed that integrates all nessesary scripts, objects, and mechanics for testing and gameplay.

## Project Challenges

- Ensuring proper physics settings for spheres to jump.
- Coordinating various scripts and components for a cohesive gaming experience.

## Project Results

- The Unity project was successfully developed with the specified mechanics and tasks.
- All tasks were implemented as described in the project requirements.

## Conclusion

The Unity Game Development Project has achieved its objectives by successfully implementing the desired mechanics and features. The project demonstrates the team's ability to create an engaging and interactive game within the Unity game engine.
